# GitHub Agent (Model Context Protocol)

A lightweight repository to explore and demonstrate the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for connecting AI models to external tools, data, and systems in a secure, structured, and interoperable way.

## What is the Model Context Protocol?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open, tool-agnostic protocol that standardizes how AI models discover, describe, and safely call external capabilities. It defines a common schema for:
- Tools (callable functions/commands)
- Resources (read-only data providers)
- Prompts (templated instructions)
- Events and sessions (stateful model–server interaction)

MCP separates “what a capability is” (contract) from “how it’s transported,” enabling multiple transports (WebSocket, HTTP, SSE, etc.) while keeping the capability interface stable.

## Why MCP?

- Interoperability: Works across different models, runtimes, and tool servers.
- Safety: Explicit capability disclosure, argument schemas, and non-interactive execution options.
- Observability: Structured messages and events enable auditing and debugging.
- Extensibility: Add new tools/resources without breaking existing clients.
- Portability: One tool server can serve multiple models/clients.

## Core Concepts

- Tools: Named, typed functions the model can call with validated parameters; results are structured.
- Resources: Read-only data streams or endpoints the model can fetch/browse.
- Prompts: Reusable, parameterized instructions/models of interaction.
- Sessions: A conversation context with capability discovery, calls, and streaming events.
- Capabilities Manifest: Server describes its tools/resources/prompts in a machine-readable schema.

## Transports

MCP is transport-agnostic. Common transports:
- WebSocket: Bidirectional streaming, low-latency tool calls and events.
- HTTP/JSON: Request–response, suitable for serverless or firewalled contexts.
- SSE/Events: Unidirectional stream from server to client for notifications.

Clients and servers negotiate the transport but keep the same capability schemas.

## Security and Safety

- Explicit opt-in: Clients discover and must opt-in to each tool.
- JSON schemas: Validate inputs/outputs and constrain model actions.
- Non-interactive flags: Prevent long-running or interactive commands unless explicitly allowed.
- Auditing: Structured logs of calls, arguments, and results.

## Quick Start (Conceptual)

1. Run an MCP server that exposes tools/resources:
   - Define tools with names, descriptions, and JSON Schemas for parameters/results.
   - Optionally expose resources (e.g., files, APIs) and prompts.

2. Connect an MCP-compatible client (e.g., an IDE agent or LLM runtime):
   - Client discovers server capabilities.
   - Client requests a session and invokes tools with validated arguments.

3. Observe results and iterate:
   - Add tools/resources incrementally.
   - Rely on schema validation for safety and reliability.

## Example Use Cases

- Dev tooling: Lint, test, build, deploy through typed tools.
- Data access: Query knowledge bases, vector stores, or docs as resources.
- Ops automation: PagerDuty, Kubernetes, incident runbooks via controlled tools.
- Content workflows: CMS operations with strict schemas and audit logs.

## Best Practices

- Keep tools small and composable.
- Provide clear descriptions and strict schemas.
- Mark long-running or interactive operations explicitly.
- Version your capability manifest.
- Log inputs/outputs for traceability.

## Ecosystem

- Servers: Any runtime can implement an MCP server (Node, Python, Go, etc.).
- Clients: IDE agents, chat agents, and custom model runtimes.
- Bridges: Wrappers to expose existing systems as MCP tools/resources.
